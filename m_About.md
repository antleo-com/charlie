# About


In July 2017, I left many years of experience in the corporate world behind, and launched into the exciting enterprise of making a living as a freelance writer. I soon founded [Antleo](https://www.antleo.com), a niche branding agency, working together with a small team of writers and designers on interesting and captivating marketing projects.
