#### ***How Private Investigators are Playing Substantial Roles in Business Fraud Investigations in India***

Ever since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mooted the idea of a 'Digital India' in 2015, both the government and the corporate sector have launched several initiatives to improve India's digital landscape. Digitally enabled delivery of many public and private sector services has empowered citizens, freeing them from cumbersome paperwork and red tape.

## The dangers of business in a digital world

The flip side of the digital coin is that today's technologies make indulging in cyber crime and corporate fraud increasingly easy, while also making investigation and prosecution increasingly difficult. India with the third highest number of internet users in the world, is seeing cyber crime incidents rising year-on-year. A 2018 Symantec Internet Security Threat report places it among the top five countries to be affected, and Kroll's 10th Global Fraud & Risk Report- 2017/18, researched by Forrester Consulting, noted that Indian cyber security breaches have been continuously on the rise across industry sectors, with 84% of surveyed executives reporting incidents of various types. India scores much higher than the global averages for almost all categories of fraud vulnerability such as embezzlement, intellectual property (IP) theft, piracy, and counterfeiting.

Clearly, cyber crime and corporate fraud are problems that can no longer be ignored.

## Attacks from without and within

Random cyber criminals are typically to blame for phishing, and virus or worm attacks that commonly target corporate data centers for employee records, trade secrets or IP, and customer records. But dangers may also lurk within the company itself. Frequently businesses find fraud committed by people already in a business relationship with them â€“ joint venture partners, employees, customers, suppliers, and vendors. The frauds can range from falsified documents relating to education, career history, or financial standing, to incorrect asset declarations by loan defaulters, theft of classified information, insurance fraud, or industrial espionage.

These frauds have repercussions that extend beyond just financial loss. Depending on the nature of the crime, the well-being, safety, and morale of employees within the company can suffer, company reputation can take a hit, regulatory relationships get strained, and business continuity itself can be severely impacted.

## Tackling the menace

In early 2018, news reports stated that in view of the increasing prevalence of cyber crimes, the Indian government would be creating a federal agency called the National Cyber Investigation Agency, with a pan-Indian jurisdiction.

But corporates may not be all that enthused. When it comes to corporate investigations, many have already discovered that the existing local police cyber crime units are neither nimble nor technologically proficient enough. The new national agency is likely to face the same challenge these units face, namely the inability to recruit the technology talent needed. Given the fact that good cyber forensics skills are in critical short supply and highly paid by the private sector, a typical governmental agency would find it difficult to match the facilities and perks offered by the private sector.

Corporates also cannot rely on governmental agencies to maintain the confidentiality of the data and other information they have to submit for the investigative process. Without effective and stringent data privacy related laws in place, any leaks of such critical information to the press and the public, can severely impact a company's competitiveness in the marketplace, while also causing reputational and financial losses.

Moreover, with a myriad varieties of fraud possible, the corporate sector cannot reach out to governmental agencies for each and every preventive investigation, such as employee academic verification checks, financial due diligence audits for mergers and acquisitions, discreet social background checks on potential senior personnel hires and other such. Thus, except for high-profile criminal cases, businesses are of necessity turning to the private sector for most business investigations

## Private investigators to the rescue

Companies find technologically savvy corporate investigators the right boon to their bane. They can sign water-tight non-disclosure agreements with such agencies to prevent any confidential and potentially damaging information from leaking out. Further, many types of corporate frauds are executed across international borders and fall into gray areas of national laws. A private fraud investigator, unlike government agents operates mostly under the radar, unhampered by international treaties or the lack of them. With increasing expertise in investigating cases relating to corporate espionage, extortion, ransomware demands, and data theft, many intelligence gatherers are also branching out into providing hardware and software solutions and services. These include debugging and counter-surveillance of corporate offices, ethical hacking, access control systems and the like.

## Investigating the Investigators

In the increasingly murky world of business, companies also need bullet-proof reliability on the investigators they hire. But the private investigation industry in India is completely unregulated, and abound with several fly-by-night operators with suspect capabilities and credentials. Several such operators promise the moon in terms of results, but simply lack the skills and expertise required for the complex nature of cases today. After getting a contract, they are unable to deliver, with investigations taking forever to complete. Also, with all the company secrets that fraud investigators eventually become privy too, a rogue operator can cause immeasurable harm.

Companies would do better to turn to the established large consulting firms that have set up dedicated units that focus on corporate fraud. On the other hand, smaller businesses with smaller budgets and with no expertise of hiring private investigators would find the SherlockZone platform very useful. SherlockZone lists the various risk management professionals in the market, and along with verifying and reviewing their capabilities and credentials, also provides unbiased ratings through in-depth research. Armed with this kind of information, smaller firms are better equipped to shortlist and partner with trustworthy and capable agencies. These are the agencies that will prevent and detect existence-threatening corporate frauds before it becomes too late.
